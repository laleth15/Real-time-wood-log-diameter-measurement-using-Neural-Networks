# Real-time-wood-log-diameter-measurement-using-Neural-Networks

Accurate measurement of wood log diameters is crucial in various industries such as forestry, timber processing, and wood manufacturing. Traditional measurement methods often involve manual labor and lack real-time capabilities, leading to inefficiencies and potential safety concerns for the workers. We focus on a problem in a specific process called “debarking” involved in the wood and timber processing industry. The heavy machinery used for debarking often comes with physical limitations, such as the minimum and maximum diameters of wood logs it can handle. If not inspected properly, wood logs can get lodged in the machine, causing it to break down, which in turn costs the industry time and money to get the system back running. To address these problems, we present a real-time wood log diameter measurement system using a live IP camera video
stream at the debarking machine, leveraging an automated computer vision system and deep neural networks (DNNs). Evaluation results show that our systems can accurately detect wood logs in real-time at an 82.16% detection rate and determine the size of each wood log in inches with a 1.36% error rate.
